There is some doubt about this and the structure may have been an intermediate building to bring water down to a lower level for entry to a penstock.

There is a short length of channel on top of the structure but elsewhere the race is no longer extant - although vegetation may conceal some evidence. The width of the structure is 2.1m and the channel is 1.1m wide. The channel inside the structure measures .65 x .55m and there is evidence of a metal grille at the top to catch debris as water flowed in from the race.

Became disused by 1947, according to oral accounts when newer cotton and grain mill was built by Myltiades Mylonas just north of this mill, on the other side of the Evrykhou-Troodos road (BU0060). Situated at the top of 3 terraces, and mill house was on second while turbine room was at the lowest (third). Koftousa situated on upper level branching east off main water channel at a right angle, leading into earth filled, disused penstock at same level, along short leat (about 3m). Penstock of irregular river boulders and tile chinking. Main water channel flow continues northward for about 4m to bifurcate distribution node (BU0071) with waterfall outflow of eastermost fork and overhead to leat of Mylonas mill on the westernmost fork.  Waterfall of channel outflow drops about 4.5m in height to the second terrace-level down and flows into earth and stone walled channel which flows in front of remains of mill house on lower terrace. The penstock (koudouka) is 2.9X2.50m and 1.20m high, with a round vaulted outflow (with dressed ashlar limestone quoins) is set under a terrace and visible on the east-facing terrace wall, 4m lower.  The water chute of the penstock thus appears to be 6.20m high while the round vault is about 4 m. long, from penstock to outflow, under the terrace and about 2m high. The mill house was L-shaped, only the north porch (approx. 5 X 4m) surviving.  The porch leans against the north wall of the penstock and has an opening the full width of the room facing north. The foundations are of four irregular courses of basalt and river boulders with basalt chinking, with 17 rows of baked solid bricks (east facade). Two more rows have been added to support irregular wooden beams and corrugated roofing. The interior of the porch has been subdivided by nailing old hand-hewn wooden planks 0.28 X 0.04-5 cm thick along the middle of the room onto old doors. Inside the porch is a brick firepace (niskia) with rectangular niches (thyroudes) symmetrically placed high above. Next to the fireplace is a drystone low wall and a cemented water trough. A pithari is placed on its side and used as a dog kennel. Water flow of main channel flows alongside front of porch. Access to porch and access to where mill house used to be is made over water channel on two humped bridges of dressed limestone ashlar quoins set into basalt stone supporting walls, topped with earth.
