After being bisected by a modern road, the line continued with 2 olive trees in a ploughed agricultural field, and then extended onto the next two lower terraces. This planting strategy (i.e., along a gully, perpendicular to the Karkotis river) is not uncommon on the west side of the valley, as it permits maximum utilization of water run-off and sediment from the slope. We noted rows of stones placed at base of the trees to trap water and sediment, and tree-roots exposed by soil erosion where the stones had been removed (to facilitate recent grain cultivation).

Manganese stains common along cracks and pores throughout the unit. Smooth, very abrupt upper contact (erosional unconformity). Near the channel margins, this unit grades into mixed alluvium and regolith - clasts consist largely of angular, slightly-weathered basalt.63-117 Unit II and III: Channel and overbank alluvium; flood deposits.63-77 Unit II (PU02) Channel lag deposit. 10YR4/3 dry; massive; SCL; 30% subrounded, coarse(65mm) gravel-sized clasts, including, bone, ceramics, and charcoal; clast lithology includes basalt and also dunite, graniodiorite, and gabbro; inclusions of channel cobble lag deposits; clear wavy upper contact.77-117 Unit III (PU03) overbank flood deposits, subsequent pedogenesis and burial = 3ABb. 10YR4/2 dry; weak medium subangular blocky structure; Gravelly SiCL; 10% fine to medium poorly to well-rounded gravel-sized clasts; many very fine pores; poor sorting (mixing) of clast sizes suggest possible agricultural use or extensive pedoturbation; abrupt, smooth upper contact (erosional unconformity).

This is what he told us about it; needs revisiting and recording properly. People went from Aspri to work at Foukassa. Houses partitioned (like those of Mandres tous Jerenides and Pera Yitonia (TP038, TP039)) and divided to separate inhabitants from the animals (goats). Water can be found on the mountain top. His father spent 6 months a year with his goats at Aspri. It was ruined then, though the walls were rather higher; it's probably 400 years old. His father laid pine logs and branches over the walls as a roof. The goats grazed; they liked the urtica leaves. Then they would move on to Asinou or Karterouni; once the goats had eaten the food there, they would move on again. They spent 6 months in each place. The whole area had grapes, figs, and ????fa (zizifa; Zizyphus spinochristi?): with the zizifa they would eat the fruit, cut the stone on each side, put a hole through for string, and use it as a worry bead. He was here in 1941-42. There were lots of old sherds, with colours [like a 15-16c sgraffito base we found]: they put oil and a wick in them, and used them for lamps. His father told him, 'Don't break them, leave them here for next year.' The church was full of coloured glazed vessels [like the sgraffito base, which came from the same place]. Now they've bulldozed it totally, to make the water tank and the bulldozed terrace it sits on. It had a paved floor. The apse was on the east side, on the edge of the bulldozed terrace. It was the church of Ayios Efxivios. The icon of Ayios Efxivios was taken to the church at Astromeritis. 100 year old pine in middle of settlement; grew up since the settlement. [Ribbed pithos from church site] His grandfather, from his grandfather, remembers that there used to be 8,000 people at this settlement.

A square of 27 x 27 m was laid out using the north east corner of the grid of the geophysical survey as starting point. The field was surveyed in grid circles (36) and a representative sample was collected. The centres of the corner circles were placed one meter from the corners of the grid. The areas between the circles were divided into 25 units (PU01-25) and a grab was made by the principles of selecting forms that had not appeared in the circles. Two extraordinary finds were collected outside the 27x27 grid, but the coordinates were simply extended to include this area (PU31 and ) in the grab. The collection produced an impressive range of heavy and light utility forms to be analysed later in an article by Angus, Alexis and myself, but there is little doubt that the area was used for living and working. The selection of tile types is limited compared toSkouriotissa, which is not inconsistent with a settlement as tiles would have been used for more important buildings primarily. The results of the entire area based on last seasons work led to a preliminary estimation of the chronology of the site as dating from the 1st c. BC to the early 7th c. AD with a hiatus in the 2nd to 3rd c. AD, a chronological horizon typical for all of Cyprus. This year.s work at TP104 has produced almost exclusively Late Roman finds and possibly the finds form the earlier periods belong to the general back ground noise found all over the area this season and the last.

The structure sits high on the eastern side of the spur, just below the top, and faces SE across the valley towards the Asinou mountains and Moutti tou Dhia. This valley is cultivated, and outside the forest boundary. View from the top of the spur is panoramic:mountains beyond Phlasou, Vouni, Skouriotissa, Morphou Bay, Kyrenia Mountains, almost to Nicosia. The forest boundary runs along the spur (Forest Cairn 224 is immediately above the structure), so the structure is only just outside the forest. The structure and the area round it are heavily overgrown with grass etc. The spur has thin pine, with open areas of grass interspersed with jujube. There is lots of thyme in the surrounding area, but not immediately round the structure.","The structure is made of mud brick on a stone socle. The socle is built of chunks of angular basalt, carefuly laid in approximate courses, neatly faced. There are large amounts of tile chinking (half-round village tile). The socle varies from 0.5 to 1.5 m high. Many of the tiles are overfired, and there was one clear deformed wasters. There are substantial numbers of fired solid brick 7.0 cm high built into the wall. Room 2 had a few large tile fragments on the ground, but these might have fallen from the walls.      The main room (Room 1) has 2 doors, one facing downhill to the SE, the other leading into the next 'open' room (Room 2). The other 3 rooms are open to the SE.     The surrounding area is disturbed by military trenches, but even so there is no sign of any enclosure. It is hard to see this as a purpose-built mandra: the enclosure is the most important part, and it is very different to the Makheras mandra complexes. It could have been used as a mandra relatively recently, hence its name. There are other rural structures which get called mandres, even though they are clearly not (e.g. Mandra tous Jerenides; Kato Koutraphas Mandres).

Open forest.,Located by ESG during field survey. West of Ayios Theodoros Pano Atsa TP241 on sidehill. TP255 consists of 4 rooms with some attached and others not. Sructure is stone socle with only 3 feet at the most still standing. No mud brick is present. Possible stairs or collapse of mudbrick. In general the area is very overgrown. Area to the northwest is currently under olive cultivation and it appears that the structures will not be preserved for long.  Likely that much of the structure has been disturbed by cultivation and road building. Possible enclosure - only 3 of 4 walls still preserved. Overall the complex is quite large. Believed by locals to be a mandra called Mandra tou Araklethi (Mr Christostomos). Complex is located on a path that links foothills to the forest. The remains of an oven are located to the south of these structures.,494601.00,416.00,ESG,10/2/2006 00:00:00,No,No,None,No,No,Asinou,No,No,Palloura,No,No,No,3879533.00,No,49,TP255,Unclear,No,No,ESG,11/6/2003 00:00:00,,Yes,No,Yes,No,,,,Yes,None,No,GPS,Structure complex of 4 or more rooms - stone built.
